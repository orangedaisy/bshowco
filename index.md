## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bobby.

I'm a [User Experience Engineer](/what-i-do/) from the scruffy little city of
Knoxville, TN. At [FPX](https://www.fpx.com/), I help design better SCPQ
solutions that make complex workflows approachable.

I have work available at the following sources:

- [Portfolio](/portfolio/)
- [Github](https://github.com/orangedaisy/)
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/bobbyshowalter/)
