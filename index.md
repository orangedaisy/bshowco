## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bobby.

I'm a [User Experience Engineer](/what-i-do/) from the scruffy little city of
Knoxville, TN. At [FPX](https://www.fpx.com/), I work with OEMs in the fluid
dynamics industry to design and build powerful SCPQ software for users all
around the world.

I have work available at the following sources:

- [Freelancing Portfolio](https://www.bshow.co/portfolio/)
- [Github](https://github.com/orangedaisy/)
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/bobbyshowalter/)

Due to the nature of my work with FPX, I am usually unable to discuss the
details of those projects. If there's anything you'd like to know about my work
as a User Experience Engineer for FPX, [reach out over
email](mailto:bobby.showalter@gmail.com) and I'll do my best to help answer your
questions.
