## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bobby.

I'm a [User Experience Engineer](/what-i-do/) from the scruffy little city of
Knoxville, TN. At [FPX](https://www.fpx.com/), I work with OEMs in the fluid
dynamics industry to design and build powerful SCPQ software for engineers and
distributors all around the world.

I have work available at the following sources:

- [Freelance Portfolio](/portfolio/)
- [Github](https://github.com/orangedaisy/)
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/bobbyshowalter/)
