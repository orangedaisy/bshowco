## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bobby.

I'm a [user experience engineer](/what-i-do/) from the scruffy little city of
Knoxville, TN. At [Intelliquip](https://www.intelliquip.com/), I work with OEMs
in the fluid dynamics industry to design and build powerful CPQ software for
users all around the world. You can find some of my work online at my [Orange
Daisy portfolio](https://www.orangedaisy.co/work/), my [GitHub
profile](https://github.com/orangedaisy/), and my [CodePen
profile](https://codepen.io/bobbyshowalter/).
