I'm currently employed as a *User Experience Engineer.*

### What is a User Experience Engineer?

Great question! I sit at the crossroads of UI, UX, and Front-end Development. I
also dabble in business strategy and project management.

At [Intelliquip](https://intelliquip.com/), this means I'm responsible for:

- User research and testing (most often through interviews)
- Collecting, shaping, and prioritizing requirements
- Reconciling those requirements with business and customer goals
- Collaborating with developers to discover potential pitfalls before design
  begins
- Designing the UI
- Documenting the UI through pattern libraries and design specs
- Developing the UI
- Collaborating with developers so they're empowered to implement UI features
  without me

I work cross-functionally with customers and their internal representatives,
executive management, middle management, and developers to create and deliver
all of the above in a timeline and budget that satisfies everyone's needs.

### What does a typical day or week look like?

Most days, I'm doing some form of prototyping or asset development. For
lower fidelity prototyping, I usually sketch or draw rough wireframes on my
[iPad](/uses/#129-ipad-pro-2018-with-apple-pencil-2). If we're far enough along
that we need higher fidelity, I'll jump into
[CodePen](https://codepen.io/bobbyshowalter/) so I can work with code. CodePen's
sterile environment gives me the space I need to focus on the actual problem at
hand, without worrying about the overhead of an entire application environment.
When it comes time to commit these artifacts to real code in a real application,
I use what I explored in the CodePen phase (or the mockup sketches, in the case
of leveraging existing components) to write any necessary HTML, CSS, or JS to
deliver a solution.

Outside of putting code on the screen, I also work closely with our customer
representatives and executive management to ensure my work is aligned with
everyone's goals. The customer reps help provide any background and feedback I
need from real users of our applications. Where necessary, I work with our
executives to present research findings, discuss mockup proposals, and gather
any necessary input about our internal goals for a particular set of work.
