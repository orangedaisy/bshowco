I'm currently employed as a *User Experience Engineer.*

### What is a User Experience Engineer?

Great question! I sit at the crossroads of UI, UX, and Front-end Development. I
also dabble in business strategy and project management.

At [FPX](https://www.fpx.com/), this means I'm responsible for:

- User research and testing (most often through interviews)
- Collecting, shaping, and prioritizing requirements
- Reconciling those requirements with business and customer goals
- Collaborating with developers to discover potential technical pitfalls before
  design begins
- Designing the UI
- Documenting the UI through pattern libraries and design specs
- Developing the UI
- Collaborating with developers so they're empowered to implement UI features
  without me

I work cross-functionally with customers and their internal representatives,
executive management, middle management, and developers to create and deliver
all of the above in a timeline and budget that satisfies everyone's needs.

### What does a typical day or week look like?

Most days, I'm doing some form of prototyping or asset development. For
lower fidelity prototyping, I usually sketch or draw rough wireframes on my
[iPad](/uses/#129-ipad-pro-2018-with-apple-pencil-2). If we're far enough along
that we need higher fidelity, I'll jump into
[CodePen](https://codepen.io/bobbyshowalter/) so I can work with code. CodePen's
sterile environment gives me the space I need to focus on the actual problem at
hand, without worrying about the overhead of an entire application environment.
When it comes time to commit these artifacts to real code in a real application,
I use what I explored in the CodePen phase (or the mockup sketches, in the case
of leveraging existing components) to write any necessary HTML, CSS, or JS to
deliver a solution. I engage with developers early and often to make sure my
work is documented, understood, and aware of any potential pitfalls or
limitations on the technical side of things.

Outside of putting code on the screen, I also work closely with our customer
representatives and executive management to ensure my work is aligned with
everyone's goals. The customer reps help provide any background and feedback I
need from real users of our applications. Where necessary, I work with our
executives to present research findings, discuss mockup proposals, and gather
any necessary input about our internal goals for a particular set of work.

### What have you done lately?

We started rolling out a new pair of product offerings for our customers in
early 2020. These new products replace older technology with an improved
interface design and user experience, and are more readily customizable for
organizations who wish to white-label our software. It was immensely rewarding
working with customers to identify their pain points with our previous
offerings, and design solutions that addressed their needs. We were even able to
uncover new opportunities for quality-of-life improvements that couldn't have
been realized otherwise.

After shipping those products, I turned my focus to documenting the emergent
patterns and designs from that experience. I'm currently organizing this
documentation into a styleguide and pattern library that will inform future
redesign and harmonization efforts throughout the rest of our software suite.

### What have people said about your work?

As I mentioned before, a large part of my job is interacting with customers,
whether through representatives, or directly. Those customer insights are
crucial to the success of our applications. Here's what a customer had to say
after we gave a demo of a new custom feature for a unique workflow they wanted
to implement:

> I didnâ€™t want to say this during the call in front of my boss [VP
Marketing] because [after he said good things about our solution,] I did not
want to sound like I was sucking up to my boss. [chuckle]<br><br>When you showed
the mockup, I had to mute my phone. I was so impressed how you went from our
silly little mockup ideas, and totally blew me away. I am so impressed by just
how simple you were able to boil it down in the mockup.

When our marketing department unveiled a new graphic it wanted to use in company
demos, it spawned a heated internal discussion. Instead of putting focus on the
value our company could provide to potential customers, some design elements of
the graphic generated negative attention that distracted from its intended
purpose. I provided targeted feedback that addressed the graphic's shortcomings
in a cost effective manner and brought the conversation back to a more
productive tone. The graphic's designer shared these comments after the dust
settled:

> I've been looking at comments on the graphic and compiling them. Nothing
yet, but we are working on it and considering everything.<br><br>The main reason
I'm emailing I noticed for almost every problem you bring, you propose a
solution. Sometimes you spell it out, sometimes it's implicit.<br><br>Just
wanted to say thank you for structuring it that way. This is very helpful.

### Where can I view examples of your work at FPX?

Our primary business at FPX is enterprise B2B software, so I'm unable to share
details about the exact deliverables I produce (you wouldn't want me sharing
your or your customers' proprietary IP, would you?).

I do have a few blog posts that cover some interesting challenges I've faced:

- [CSS Grid Layout Notes](/2017/06/14/css-grid-layout-notes/)
- [Multiple Layouts Made Easy with CSS Grid](/2018/06/03/multiple-layouts-made-easy-with-css-grid/)
- [Intelliquip Featured on Hotjar](/2018/06/06/intelliquip-featured-on-hotjar/)
- [Making the Most of a Bad
  CSSituation](/2020/03/11/making-the-most-of-a-bad-cssituation/)
