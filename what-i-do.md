I'm a full-time *User Experience Engineer* for
[Revalize](https://www.revalizesoftware.com/). I transform complex SCPQ
workflows into user-friendly experiences by collaborating with developers,
product owners, executives, and our OEM and engineer customers.

### What is a User Experience Engineer?

Great question! I sit at the crossroads of UI, UX, and Front-end Development. I
also dabble in business strategy and project management.

This means I'm responsible for:

- User research and testing (most often through interviews)
- Collecting, shaping, and prioritizing requirements
- Reconciling those requirements with business and customer goals
- Collaborating with developers to discover potential technical pitfalls before
  design begins
- Designing the UI
- Documenting the UI through pattern libraries and design specs
- Developing the UI
- Collaborating with developers so they're empowered to implement UI features
  without me

### What does a typical day or week look like?

Most days, I'm doing some form of prototyping or asset development. For lower
fidelity prototyping, I usually sketch or draw rough wireframes on my
[iPad](/uses/#129-ipad-pro-2018-with-apple-pencil-2). If we're far enough along
that we need higher fidelity, I'll jump into
[CodePen](https://codepen.io/bobbyshowalter/) so I can work with code. CodePen's
sterile environment gives me the space I need to focus on the actual problem at
hand, without worrying about the overhead of an entire application environment.
I'm also working on an internal tool to support HTML/CSS/JS mockup development
without CodePen.

When it comes time to commit these artifacts to real code in a real application,
I use what I explored in the mockup phase to write any necessary HTML, CSS, or
JS to deliver a solution. I engage with developers early and often to make sure
my work is documented, understood, and aware of any potential pitfalls or
limitations on the technical side of things.

Outside of putting code on the screen, I also work closely with our customer
representatives and executive management to ensure my work is aligned with
everyone's goals. The customer reps help provide any background and feedback I
need from real users of our applications. Where necessary, I work with our
executives to present research findings, discuss mockup proposals, and gather
any necessary input about our internal goals for a particular set of work.

### What have you done lately?

I engage with our sales and marketing teams quite a bit these days to support
the strategy efforts around a new product offering for our Distributor users.
The SCPQ workflows for these users can be very complex, so I created prototypes
in Figma to map user journeys and demonstrate key points of interaction. We use
these prototypes to interview potential user Orgs and gather feedback on how to
best shape this new product for our customers.

Design process has also been a big theme this year. In addition to working more
with Figma, I have started to build a new internal tool for developing
HTML/CSS/JS mockups and prototypes. This work was typically handled in CodePen,
but the friction of importing that work from another platform have made it
difficult to collaborate with developers. Building our own in-house tool means
my mockups can be version-controlled with git, readily shared with other
developers, and deployed to more contexts to make sharing with stakeholders and
customers a frictionless process. I'm using the incredible static site generator
[11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) as the foundation for this project.

### What have people said about your work?

A large part of my job is interacting with customers, whether through
representatives, or directly. Those customer insights are crucial to the success
of our applications. Here's what a customer had to say after we gave a demo of a
new custom feature I designed for their unique workflow:

> I didnâ€™t want to say this during the call in front of my boss [VP
Marketing] because [after he said good things about our solution,] I did not
want to sound like I was sucking up to my boss. [chuckle]<br><br>When you showed
the mockup, I had to mute my phone. I was so impressed how you went from our
silly little mockup ideas, and totally blew me away. I am so impressed by just
how simple you were able to boil it down in the mockup.

When our marketing department unveiled a new graphic it wanted to use in company
demos, it spawned a heated internal discussion. Instead of putting focus on the
value our company could provide to potential customers, some design elements of
the graphic generated negative attention that distracted from its intended
purpose. I provided targeted feedback that addressed the graphic's shortcomings
in a cost effective manner and brought the conversation back to a more
productive tone. The graphic's designer shared these comments after the dust
settled:

> I've been looking at comments on the graphic and compiling them. Nothing
yet, but we are working on it and considering everything.<br><br>The main reason
I'm emailing I noticed for almost every problem you bring, you propose a
solution. Sometimes you spell it out, sometimes it's implicit.<br><br>Just
wanted to say thank you for structuring it that way. This is very helpful.
