title: "Now served over HTTPS"
---

I'm a little late writing a post on this, but this blog (and a few other sites I
have on GitHub) is now being served over HTTPS.

GitHub enabled the feature for custom domains on [May
1st](https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/).
Making the switch is usually as easy as ticking a checkbox:

{% include figure.html src='/assets/images/github_custom_domain_https.png'
alt='Enable HTTPS for Custom Domain on GitHub Pages' caption='Checkbox to enable
HTTPS for Custom Domains on GitHub Pages' %}

One of my domains doesn't seem compatible at the moment, however:

{% include figure.html src='/assets/images/github_custom_domain_no_https.png'
alt='Domain unable to use HTTPS' caption="Can't enable HTTPS for this domain.
Name redacted because it's undergoing a redesign :)" %}

Not sure if it's because of the age of the repo or what, but I didn't have any
issues with my other repos.
