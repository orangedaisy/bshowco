About a year into my job as User Experience Engineer at [Intelliquip,
Inc.](https://intelliquip.com), we were confronted with a difficult user flow
challenge. We had an existing user set that needed to onboard with a new suite
of applications, but their previous account details needed to be updated with
some extra details required by the new software.

As part of the first-time login experience, these special "half-n-half" users
were presented with an account details page before completing the login. After
the missing information was completed, they were redirected to the login page
with a Rails "flash" message asking that they confirm their email before
attempting to login again. Unfortunately, the way this workflow was originally
designed meant that users were caught off-guard at multiple points, and unable
to achieve their goal of logging in and using the new system.

Thanks to [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com), however, we were able to rapidly
iterate through design changes that ultimately led to the successful onboarding
of 10,000 users. We used a combination of Hotjar's session recordings and
collaboration on Google Docs to make the tweaks and changes necessary to help
our users.
