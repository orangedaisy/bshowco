### FPX

I'm currently a full-time User Experience Engineer for
[FPX](https://www.fpx.com/) (now part of
[Revalize](https://revalizesoftware.com/)). As a UXE, I work with developers,
executives, and customers alike to support the entire product lifecycle from
ideation through implementation.

[What I Do](/what-i-do/) has a more detailed write-up about my position and
experience.

Here are some posts from my blog that cover various challenges I've encountered
at FPX:

### Showalter Family website

My wife and I started a small [family website](https://www.showalter.family/) in
2020 to help us break free from social media. I used
[11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to
put together something that's as easy for my wife to work with as it is for me
to develop. We use this site to keep track of our favorite
[recipes](https://www.showalter.family/recipes/), share updates about our
[garden](https://www.showalter.family/garden/), and more.

### The Manor at Stowers Hill

I also work with Lori and Chat at [The Manor at Stowers
Hill](https://www.themanoratstowershill.com/) to design and maintain the website
for their event venue. We built their site on
[Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com/) and [Netlify
CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org) to deliver a user-friendly editing experience
with the speed of pure HTML
