    <h3>Showalter Family site</h3>
    <p>My wife and I started a small <a
    href="https://www.showalter.family/">family website</a> in 2020 to help us
    break free from social media. I used <a
    href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> and <a
    href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlify CMS</a> to put together something
    that's as easy for my wife to work with as it is for me to develop. We use
    this site to keep track of our favorite <a
    href="https://www.showalter.family/recipes/">recipes</a>, share updates
    about our <a href="https://www.showalter.family/garden/">garden</a>, and
    more.</p>

    <p>I also work with Lori and Chat at <a
    href="https://www.themanoratstowershill.com/">The Manor at Stowers Hill</a>
    to design and maintain the website for their event venue. We built their
    site on <a href="https://www.jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a

    editing experience with the speed of pure HTML.</p>
