title: "ðŸŽ¨ New Theme"

ðŸš§ \*cough, cough\* Pardon the dust, it should settle soon. ðŸš§

## A look back

After two and a half years of the spartan, utilitarian look, I decided it was
time to freshen up the place a bit. That original theme was not without its
purpose&mdash;consuming content on the web can be exhausting, so I wanted a
place where I could provide content free from all the shackles of modern web
presentation. I didn't use any analytics (still don't), the colors I did use
were slight tweaks on the browser defaults, and the font stack was whatever your
operating system gave you.
