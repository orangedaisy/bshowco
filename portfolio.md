I've had the pleasure of working with a few small businesses and family friends
to build their websites. Below is a selection of the work I've shipped for these
clients.

## LTB Photography

Lori has been a family friend for nearly a decade, so I was thrilled when
she asked me to design her photography studio's website. Her beautiful
photography is featured heavily throughout the site, of course, but I
focused most of our attention on the admin panel.

Making sure Lori had the tools and interface necessary to keep the site
current was a very important goal during our process. I worked closely with
Lori to understand her ideal workflow, and used a combination of built-in
WordPress functionality and extra plugins to craft an editing experience that
would be as delightful as her pictures.

Empowering clients to feel confident in their website is an important
objective of ours. I have a [case

Cordelia Smythe is the fictitious namesake of a murder mystery dinner party
company based in northern California. When I was contracted to redesign their
ecommerce website, I knew I had to emphasize this special character.

I spent a lot of time with the client hashing out the content, design, and
presentation of their website to ensure it matched the level of care and detail
they put into all of their mysteries. In order to keep the process fast and
efficient, I utilized CodePen to rapidly iterate through ideas.

The first deliverable I worked on was the [Brand
Profile](https://codepen.io/bobbyshowalter/full/25790e277f284af192a958fba1a295e9/).
Since we were reusing the majority of the content from the old design, this step
gave me an opportunity to define the building blocks for the rest of the
elements in the design. Using the brand profile, I created mockups for some of
the primary content components&mdash;like telegrams, postcards, and
notes&mdash;as well as a full-page mockup for an individual mystery feature.

Iterating through these pieces in a dependency-free environment like CodePen
kept us focused on the task at hand, and made sure we weren't getting caught up
in too many distracting details. My goal for the design was to pull the user
into the world of Cordelia Smythe before they received their murder mystery. I
think we captured Cordelia's spirit well, and the client was thrilled with the
result.

## Haleigh and Sean wedding website

It's always a treat to be involved in a couple's wedding planning. For
Haleigh and Sean, I worked with them to design a site that incorporated
their colors and theme. The design is simple and understated, placing
emphasis on the content and storytelling. This simplicity played an important
role in ensuring the site was accessible by users (family and friends) of all
ages, as well as a wide range of devices.

## Brochure site for land for sale

The requirements for this project were pretty simple: show some pictures,
provide a description, and link some documents. I took those simple
requirements and ran with an idea to create something that looked like an ad
you might see in a newspaper, relying on a clearly defined layout to section
the information.
