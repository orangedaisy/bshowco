I've had the pleasure of working with a few small businesses and family friends
to build their websites. Below is a selection of the work I've shipped for these
clients.

Interested in learning more about my work as a User Experience Engineer for FPX?

## The Manor at Stowers Hill

{% include figure.html src='/assets/images/tmash_1x.jpg' alt='' caption='' %}

The Manor at Stowers Hill is a beautiful event venue in Harriman, TN, run by
Lori and Chad Brown.

Their event space sees quite a lot of action, so ensuring
they have the ability to update their site was a big point of emphasis during
our initial discussions. We eventually settled on a Jekyll-powered static site
hosted on Netlify. Though still in its infancy, the Netlify CMS allows us to
leverage the speed of static sites, while still providing an easy-to-use
interface for managing the site content.

For the design of the website, we worked with Lori and Chad to deliver a
refined, tasteful experience that echoes the timeless beauty of their estate.
Their clients seem to agree&mdash;their new website has been fielding a
consistent stream of event appointments ever since we went live at the beginning
of February, 2020.

## Cordelia Smythe Murder Mysteries

Cordelia Smythe is the fictitious namesake of a murder mystery dinner party
company based in northern California. When I was contracted to redesign their
ecommerce website, I knew I had to emphasize this special character.

I spent a lot of time with the client hashing out the content, design, and
presentation of their website to ensure it matched the level of care and detail
they put into all of their mysteries. In order to keep the process fast and
efficient, I utilized CodePen to rapidly iterate through ideas.

The first deliverable I worked on was the [Brand
Profile](https://codepen.io/bobbyshowalter/full/25790e277f284af192a958fba1a295e9/).
Since we were reusing the majority of the content from the old design, this step
gave me an opportunity to define the building blocks for the rest of the
elements in the design. Using the brand profile, I created mockups for some of
the primary content components&mdash;like telegrams, postcards, and
notes&mdash;as well as a full-page mockup for an individual mystery feature.

Iterating through these pieces in a dependency-free environment like CodePen
kept us focused on the task at hand, and made sure we weren't getting caught up
in too many distracting details. My goal for the design was to pull the user
into the world of Cordelia Smythe before they received their murder mystery. I
think we captured Cordelia's spirit well, and the client was thrilled with the
result.

## Haleigh and Sean wedding website

It's always a treat to be involved in a couple's wedding planning. For
Haleigh and Sean, I worked with them to design a site that incorporated
their colors and theme. The design is simple and understated, placing
emphasis on the content and storytelling. This simplicity played an important
role in ensuring the site was accessible by users (family and friends) of all
ages, as well as a wide range of devices.

## Brochure site for land for sale

The requirements for this project were pretty simple: show some pictures,
provide a description, and link some documents. I took those simple
requirements and ran with an idea to create something that looked like an ad
you might see in a newspaper, relying on a clearly defined layout to section
the information.
