## FPX

I'm a [User Experience Engineer](/what-i-do/ "What I Do") at
[FPX](https://www.fpx.com/). Our primary business is enterprise B2B software, so
I'm unable to share details about the exact deliverables I produce (you wouldn't
want me sharing your or your customers' proprietary IP, would you?).

I do have a few blog posts that cover some interesting challenges I've faced:

- [CSS Grid Layout Notes](/2017/06/14/css-grid-layout-notes/)
- [Multiple Layouts Made Easy with CSS Grid](/2018/06/03/multiple-layouts-made-easy-with-css-grid/)
- [Intelliquip Featured on Hotjar](/2018/06/06/intelliquip-featured-on-hotjar/)
- [Making the Most of a Bad
  CSSituation](/2020/03/11/making-the-most-of-a-bad-cssituation/)

If you want to know more, I'm happy to [chat over
email](mailto:bobby.showalter@gmail.com) any time.

## Freelance clients

I've had the pleasure of working with a few small businesses and family friends
to build their websites. Below is a selection of the work I've shipped for these
clients.

### The Manor at Stowers Hill

{% include figure.html src='/assets/images/tmash_1x.jpg' alt='' caption='' %}

The Manor at Stowers Hill is a beautiful event venue in Harriman, TN, run by
Lori and Chad Brown.

Their event space sees quite a lot of action, so ensuring
they have the ability to update their site was a big point of emphasis during
our initial discussions. We eventually settled on a Jekyll-powered static site
hosted on Netlify. Though still in its infancy, the Netlify CMS allows us to
leverage the speed of static sites, while still providing an easy-to-use
interface for managing the site content.

For the design of the website, we worked with Lori and Chad to deliver a
refined, tasteful experience that echoes the timeless beauty of their estate.
Their clients seem to agree&mdash;their new website has been fielding a
consistent stream of event appointments ever since we went live at the beginning
of February, 2020.

### Cordelia Smythe Murder Mysteries

{% include figure.html

Cordelia Smythe is the fictitious namesake of a murder mystery dinner party
company based in northern California. When I was contracted to redesign their
ecommerce website, I knew I had to emphasize this special character.

I spent a lot of time with the client hashing out the content, design, and
presentation of their website to ensure it matched the level of care and detail
they put into all of their mysteries. In order to keep the process fast and
efficient, I utilized CodePen to rapidly iterate through ideas.

The first deliverable I worked on was the [Brand
Profile](https://codepen.io/bobbyshowalter/full/25790e277f284af192a958fba1a295e9/).
Since we were reusing the majority of the content from the old design, this step
gave me an opportunity to define the building blocks for the rest of the
elements in the design. Using the brand profile, I created mockups for some of
the primary content components&mdash;like telegrams, postcards, and
notes&mdash;as well as a full-page mockup for an individual mystery feature.

Iterating through these pieces in a dependency-free environment like CodePen
kept us focused on the task at hand, and made sure we weren't getting caught up
in too many distracting details. My goal for the design was to pull the user
into the world of Cordelia Smythe before they received their murder mystery. I
think we captured Cordelia's spirit well, and the client was thrilled with the
result.

### Haleigh and Sean wedding website

It's always a treat to be involved in a couple's wedding planning. For
Haleigh and Sean, I worked with them to design a site that incorporated
their colors and theme. The design is simple and understated, placing
emphasis on the content and storytelling. This simplicity played an important
role in ensuring the site was accessible by users (family and friends) of all
ages, as well as a wide range of devices.

### Brochure site for land for sale

{% include figure.html

The requirements for this project were pretty simple: show some pictures,
provide a description, and link some documents. I took those simple
requirements and ran with an idea to create something that looked like an ad
you might see in a newspaper, relying on a clearly defined layout to section
the information.

## Projects

Whenever I find free time in between all of the above, I like to tinker with a
few side projects.

### Showalter Family Site

This is a little site we're building out as a family. At the time of writing
this description, we're keeping a
[COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic)
journal of our experiences in quarantine. Future features of the site will
include a recipes index and blog content that isn't centered around a global
pandemic.

The tech stack is [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) with
[NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) for user-friendly content editing.
11ty took some getting used to coming from a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
background, but has been pretty nice so far. And check out that sweet `.family`
domain!

### POKéDEX App

Our son Owen has been in love with the world of Pokémon since he got [Let's Go,
Pikachu!](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-switch/)
for Christmas, 2019. I started taking a VueJS course early in 2020, and decided
to use his 4th birthday as an opportunity to build a real project with my new
skills.

The POKéDEX app uses QR codes to "catch" Pokémon and add them to your list. We
scattered these QR codes and pictures of their related Pokémon around our home
for him to find. He picked up on the idea right away and had a blast!

I've got [some more work](https://github.com/orangedaisy/pokedex/issues) I need
to do to polish some of the rougher edges now that we're past his birthday, but
it was a fun challenge to build something like this on a tight deadline and
bolster my skill set. I designed the visuals to work best with my dinky little
phone, so it might look a little odd on other devices.
