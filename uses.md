I've been cataloguing the [various iterations of my home
office](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ACREAarZbYRAi4632) for years now, but I
haven't really kept a record of what kit I'm currently using. Here's my attempt
to rectify that.

## Desk area

These pictures are out of date! We recently bought a house, so we're still
figuring out the best layout and flow for our office space. For now, enjoy the
glimpse into the past.

As a general rule, I do everything I can to keep my desk as spotless as
possible. Clean workspace, clean mindset. There are some things that demand a
permanent presence, however. These are the physical doodads that hang around my
desk area.

### The desk

Over the years, I've become more and more obsessed with increasing the total
area of my desk top. The previous version of my home office featured a
[wall-mounted, standing-height
desk](https://photos.app.goo.gl/8U47YDR3SJFcgAJx1) that clocked in at 30 sq.
ft. When we moved the office to add more work space for my wife, I opted for a
more traditional desk so that we would have the flexibility of rearranging the
room at any time.

This current desk is a standard dimension, [solid-core

on top of some [steel tube
legs](https://www.hairpinlegs.com/collections/table-legs/products/tube-leg-no-one).
While it isn't the sprawling expanse that the previous desk was, it certainly
provides plenty of space to spread out.

### Dell Latitude 5411

FPX sent over this new dev machine in early 2021. It's definitely more corporate
and stuffy-feeling than the MacBook I used for many years, but it gets the job
done well enough.

### 12.9&Prime; iPad Pro (2018) with Apple Pencil 2

I picked up an iPad Pro in the summer of 2019 to assist with my workflow at FPX.
So far, it's been a very welcome addition. I use [Goodnotes
5](https://www.goodnotes.com/) to maintain my planner, personal notes, work
notes, wireframes and sketches&mdash;just about anything I was previously using
a traditional notebook for. Keeping everything in the iPad, and specifically
within Goodnotes, makes it much easier to reference historical artifacts or
share my latest sketch or mockup.  Goodnotes makes use of OCR so that even my
mostly illegible handwriting is indexed and searchable.

The iPad fills a nice gap in my workflow, making it dead simple to sketch ideas,
share them with colleagues, iterate through improvements, and jump straight to
coding their implementation.

### iPhone SE (2020)

I use an [iPhone SE (2020)](https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/) as of June, 2020.
After a long run with the [Moto
E4+](https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Plus-4th-Generation-Lockscreen/dp/B072ZS6JD2/)
from Motorola, this more affordable iPhone was a great opportunity to widen my
collection of Apple devices and get deeper into that Ecosystem&trade;. I've been
very pleased so far, especially with how easy it is to share and coordinate
things with my wife and her matching iPhone.

### Keyboard

This is the item that always grabs attention when I take it out in public. I use
a [Kinesis Freestyle2 Ergonomic Keyboard for
PC](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0089ZYMGQ/), with the extra [VIP3
Accessory
Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Accessory-Kinesis-Freestyle2-Keyboard-KIN-FS-VIP3/dp/B008BVNQW4/),
and I can't imagine using anything else. My ergonomic keyboard journey started
with the crowd-favorite [Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard
4000](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A6PPOK/), but after encountering
some muscle strain from constantly reaching across the numpad to use the mouse,
I went searching for something else. The Kinesis allows my arms to rest in a
much more natural position when typing, as well as freeing up space inside the
keyboard for my mouse and notebooks.

### Mouse

Keeping with the ergonomic theme, I use a [Kensington Expert Wireless Trackball
Mouse](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01936N73I/) as my input device of
choice. Using just my finger tips to move the mouse is a massive relief to the
normal strain of using more arm and wrist muscles to move a traditional device.

### Displays

I'm on the 4k train now. I picked up a
[LG32UN500-W](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FPLLX6Y/) earlier this year,
and it's been a real treat. It doesn't have a ton of features, but I don't need
much more than a single HDMI for my setup, so it has worked out just fine.

### Speakers and sound

For personal music and video playing, I have the [Logitech
Z623](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VAHYTG/) system hooked up to my
laptop.

### Handmade touches

I have recently acquired a number of great quality, handmade items to make my
desk feel a little more homey.

I started with the desk organizer from [Stone-Penland
Pottery](https://www.facebook.com/stonepenlandpottery/), and have since added
one of their mugs and a little multipurpose holder thing that I'm currently
using to prop up my phone. My wife lovingly made a sleeve for the desk organizer
(to prevent pens and scissors from slipping on the desk) and desk mat out of
some wool fabric from a craft store. At the time of writing, I also have a
crocheted pumpkin she made for seasonal decor.

The reading corner features two very special Windsor chairs that my grandfather
made. I love embracing my inner 90-year old to step away from the desk, don my
cardigan, put on some soft jazz, and relax in the chair with a good book
(currently enjoying [The Cooking Gene](https://thecookinggene.com/) by Michael
Twitty). The two chairs also provide a nice spot for my two boys whenever they
insist on watching me work (before being immediately bored and running off
again, of course).

All of these personal touches provide a pleasing contrast to all the tech I
surround myself with, as well as remind me to take my time and be mindful of the
things I create.

### Miscellaneous

Here are the rest of the items on and around my desk that don't need as much
explanation:

- [AmazonBasics USB hub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E6GX4BG/)
- [Jabra Speak 410 USB
  Speakerphone](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007SHJIO2/) for meetings and
phone calls

- [Safco Foot Cushion](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MS6XW8/)
- Leather desk valet for holding my phone and tv remote

## Software

I'm sure I've missed some hugely important piece of software in this list, but
here's everything I could think of that I use on a nearly daily basis.

### Windows 10

My Dell laptop runs Windows 10. I still much prefer macOS. The WSL feature and
its integration with VSCode is pretty neat, but it overall isn't as comfy an
experience as what I had on my Mac.

### Windows Terminal and VSCode

I use the new Windows Terminal and VSCode to interact with the codebases for my
work and personal projects. For text editing in the terminal, I've started
dabbling with [neovim](https://neovim.io/). With VSCode, I use the vim extension
to help speed up my workflow. I find the vim experience there to be hit-or-miss,
but on the whole it's better than not having it at all.

### Git

I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as my VCS of choice. I have limited experience
with [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/), but I find Git to be superior.
Using Git from the command line may seem hardcore, but I would much rather take
the time to understand the mechanics of what Git is doing than rely on some GUI
abstraction that makes weighty operations just a little too easy.

### Design software

At one time or another, I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), [Adobe
XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), and
[Figma](https://www.figma.com/). They all have their pros and cons, and I do
admire the level to which some people can operate them. I just have the hardest
time adjusting my HTML/CSS/JS-oriented thinking to their differing paradigms.

These days, I do have to use Figma somewhat regularly. I at least appreciate the
great strides they've made with components and the flexbox-like Auto Layout. The
prototype experience is still abysmal. It's still a challenge to re-configure my
brain for the way Figma thinks I should work compared to the way CSS actually
works.

My ideal process involves sketching in varying levels of fidelity before jumping
straight into code. To that end, I've taken to using an
[iPad](#129-ipad-pro-2018-with-apple-pencil-2) with [Goodnotes](#Goodnotes-5)
for my primary design software experience.

### Mozilla Firefox

I moved over to Firefox at the prodding of a coworker a few months ago. I don't
know that it's leagues better than Chrome, but I do appreciate using something
other than Google's version of the web. I've also become less invested in the
Google ecosystem as I dig farther into Apple's, so shedding Chrome hasn't been a
big loss.

### Slack

Just about every industry-related professional or social conglomeration I'm a
part of uses [Slack](https://slack.com/) these days. I'm not a huge fan of its
lack of notification management, but it does its job about as well as any of the
other options.

### Goodnotes 5

I touched on this briefly in the [iPad](#129-ipad-pro-2019-with-apple-pencil-2)
section above, but I use [Goodnotes 5](https://www.goodnotes.com/) quite a lot.
It has my planner, my work and personal notes, my to do lists, notes from
church&mdash;just about anything I would care to write down is done so within a
Goodnotes notebook. Its notebook/paper concept really resonates with me, and
made it very straightforward to transition from my physical mediums to digital.
I was even able to create a few custom templates that make my digital planner
and notebooks look just like their plant-based ancestors.

Goodnotes' share features are also great for collaborating with colleagues. I
can either export a single page (or entire notebook) as a PDF and send it
straight to a destination in Slack, or use the lasso tool to capture a specific
area and share that as an image. When it's time for updates, I can easily create
new pages so that we can always reference back to previous items. I have already
used it to much success for a couple of new features at work, and am excited
about making it an ever-growing part of my workflow.

### Spotify

Google killed Google Play Music, so I moved over to Spotify. Most of my music
seems to be here and the [Spotify Connect](https://www.spotify.com/us/connect/)
feature is pretty slick, so I suppose I've come out ahead. I'm not a big snob on
music services and the quality of audio they deliver, so long as I can listen to
the things I'm interested in.
