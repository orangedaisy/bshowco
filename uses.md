I've been cataloguing the [various iterations of my home
office](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ACREAarZbYRAi4632) for years now, but I
haven't really kept a record of what kit I'm currently using. Here's my attempt
to rectify that.

As a general rule, I do everything I can to keep my desk as spotless as
possible. Clean workspace, clean mindset. There are some things that demand a
permanent presence, however. These are the physical doodads that hang around my
desk area.

### The desk

Over the years, I've become more and more obsessed with increasing the total
area of my desk top. The previous version of my home office featured a
[wall-mounted, standing-height
desk](https://photos.app.goo.gl/8U47YDR3SJFcgAJx1) that clocked in at 30 sq.
ft. When we moved the office to add more work space for my wife, I opted for a
more traditional desk so that we would have the flexibility of rearranging the
room at any time.

This current desk is a standard dimension, [solid-core
door](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Masonite-32-in-x-80-in-Smooth-Flush-Unfinished-Hardwood-Solid-Core-Birch-Veneer-Composite-Interior-Door-Slab-25344/100037604)
on top of some [steel tube
legs](https://www.hairpinlegs.com/collections/table-legs/products/tube-leg-no-one).
While it isn't the sprawling expanse that the previous desk was, it certainly
provides plenty of space to spread out.

### 13&Prime; MacBook Pro (Early 2015)

I'm currently using a 2015 13&Prime; MacBook Pro with 8GB of memory and a 512GB
SSD.  Four years feels like a long time to use the same MacBook, but it still
does everything I need it to just as fast as the day I got it. For cases where I
need more horsepower, like some development work at FPX, I typically remote into
some sort of server that can be more specially tuned for the task at hand.

I keep my Mac in clamshell mode when I'm at home, and recently grabbed [a
stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0792C2XW7/) to reduce its footprint.
The stand also elevates the laptop off the desk to guard against any accidental
spills.

### 12.9&Prime; iPad Pro (2018) with Apple Pencil 2

I picked up an iPad Pro in the summer of 2019 to assist with my workflow at FPX.
So far, it's been a very welcome addition. I use [Goodnotes
5](https://www.goodnotes.com/) to maintain my planner, personal notes, work
notes, wireframes and sketches&mdash;just about anything I was previously using
a traditional notebook for. Keeping everything in the iPad, and specifically
within Goodnotes, makes it much easier to reference historical artifacts or
share my latest sketch or mockup.  Goodnotes makes use of OCR so that even my
mostly illegible handwriting is indexed and searchable.

The iPad fills a nice gap in my workflow, making it dead simple to sketch ideas,
share them with colleagues, iterate through improvements, and jump straight to
coding their implementation. Over time, I see sketching on the iPad as a way to
reduce my dependency on prototyping tools like Figma or Adobe XD.

iPadOS was released just as I was updating this section, so I'm excited to see
how the new features can help to further enhance my productivity.

### iPhone SE (2020)

I use an [iPhone SE (2020)](https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/) as of June, 2020.
After a long run with the [Moto
E4+](https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Plus-4th-Generation-Lockscreen/dp/B072ZS6JD2/)
from Motorola, this more affordable iPhone was a great opportunity to widen my
collection of Apple devices and get deeper into that Ecosystem&trade;. I've been
very pleased so far, especially with how easy it is to share and coordinate
things with my wife and her matching iPhone.

### Keyboard

This is the item that always grabs attention when I take it out in public. I use
a [Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue Wireless Ergonomic Keyboard for
Mac](https://www.amazon.com/Freestyle2-Wireless-Ergonomic-Keyboard-Separation/dp/B00V6WWYN2/),
with the extra [VIP3 Accessory
Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Accessory-Kinesis-Freestyle2-Keyboard-KIN-FS-VIP3/dp/B008BVNQW4/),
and I can't imagine using anything else. My ergonomic keyboard journey started
with the crowd-favorite [Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard
4000](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A6PPOK/), but after encountering
some muscle strain from constantly reaching across the numpad to use the mouse,
I went searching for something else.

The Kinesis allows my arms to rest in a much more natural position when typing,
as well as freeing up space inside the keyboard for my mouse and notebooks. It
connects over bluetooth and has astonishingly long battery life. Probably the
best thing I have on my desk.

### Mouse

Keeping with the ergonomic theme, I use a [Kensington Expert Wireless Trackball
Mouse](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01936N73I/) as my input device of
choice. Using just my finger tips to move the mouse is a massive relief to the
normal strain of using more arm and wrist muscles to move a traditional device.

It isn't perfect&mdash;there are occasional connection quirks when waking the Mac
from sleep, and using its bluetooth option when other bluetooth devices are
connected to the Mac just doesn't work well at all&mdash;but it's still a huge
improvement over what I had.

### Displays

I've recently pared down to just one monitor after using two for a good while.
The Dell S2340M that fills that role is one of the oldest tech items I still
use. It only has DVI, so I use a [Mini DisplayPort to DVI
cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KAM3ICO/) to connect it to my Mac.

I also have an [Insignia Roku
TV](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/insignia-39-class-38-5-diag--led-1080p-smart-hdtv-roku-tv/4863802.p?skuId=4863802)
mounted near my desk as a tertiary display. I can connect to it via HDMI if
necessary, but I typically just use its smart features and a [2015
Chromecast](https://store.google.com/product/chromecast_2015) to put on
background media.

We nabbed a pair of [Google Nest
Hubs](https://store.google.com/us/product/google_nest_hub) from Costco during
Black Friday 2018. I keep one hub on my desk to help me manage my personal
calendar, set reminders, and control our office Chromecast Audio. Occasionally I
use it to make a phone call as well.

### Speakers and sound

For personal music and video playing, I have the [Logitech
Z623](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VAHYTG/) system hooked up to my Mac.
For more general background music, I use a [Chromecast
Audio](https://store.google.com/product/chromecast_audio) connected to a pair of
Bose bookshelf speakers located on a shelf above my desk. This allows anyone in
the office to control the music without tying up my workstation.

### Cable organizer

The [MOS Magnetic Cable
Organizer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ADWLJNW/) is a neat little
problem solver that I grabbed early in 2020. It suctions to the desk and uses
its four magnets to corral any cables you bring near it. Makes it a breeze to
pop cables out of the MacBook without worrying about them falling under the
desk.

### Handmade touches

I have recently acquired a number of great quality, handmade items to make my
desk feel a little more homey.

I started with the desk organizer from [Stone-Penland
Pottery](https://www.facebook.com/stonepenlandpottery/), and have since added
one of their mugs and a little multipurpose holder thing that I'm currently
using to prop up my phone. My wife lovingly made a sleeve for the desk organizer
(to prevent pens and scissors from slipping on the desk) and desk mat out of
some wool fabric from a craft store. At the time of writing, I also have a
crocheted pumpkin she made for seasonal decor.

The reading corner features two very special Windsor chairs that my grandfather
made. I love embracing my inner 90-year old to step away from the desk, don my
cardigan, put on some soft jazz, and relax in the chair with a good book
(currently enjoying [The Cooking Gene](https://thecookinggene.com/) by Michael
Twitty). The two chairs also provide a nice spot for my two boys whenever they
insist on watching me work (before being immediately bored and running off
again, of course).

All of these personal touches provide a pleasing contrast to all the tech I
surround myself with, as well as remind me to take my time and be mindful of the
things I create.

### Miscellaneous

Here are the rest of the items on and around my desk that don't need as much
explanation:

- [AmazonBasics USB hub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E6GX4BG/)
- [Jabra Speak 410 USB
  Speakerphone](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007SHJIO2/) for meetings and
phone calls
- [Toshiba 1TB Portable HDD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N2S6ZUQ/)
  for a TimeMachine backup
- [Cross ballpoint pen](https://www.cross.com/en/products/3502)
- [Safco Foot Cushion](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MS6XW8/)
- Leather desk valet for holding my phone and tv remote

## Software

I'm sure I've missed some hugely important piece of software in this list, but
here's everything I could think of that I use on a nearly daily basis.

### macOS

I'm currently running [macOS 10.14 Mojave](https://www.apple.com/macos/mojave/)
on my MacBook Pro. I've used various versions of Windows and Ubuntu before this.
I'll refrain from saying anything too tribal, and stick to the opinion that for
the kind of work I do, this machine and OS has been the most pleasant experience
by far. The end &#x1F603;

### iTerm2

I try to hang out in the terminal as much as possible. It's the primary place
where I traverse the filesystem, edit text, use Git, log in to remote servers,
etc. To help keep all of this in order, I use the excellent
[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/). I'm sure the built-in terminal app would be
fine for most of what I do, but iTerm is always recommended for new Mac users.
After four years, nothing else has managed to lure me away.

### Vim

Yep, I use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/). There are a lot of fancy GUI editors
these days, but the punishing intricacy of Vim has me firmly in its grasp.
Nothing else I've used gives me the ability to "edit at the speed of thought,"
so to speak.

I try to keep my configuration of Vim fairly vanilla, opting for just a few
plugins and other added niceties. Beyond Tim Pope's
[vim-cucumber](https://github.com/tpope/vim-cucumber/),
[vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/), and
[vim-rails](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails/), the most exciting things I've
added are the [vim-two-firewatch](https://github.com/rakr/vim-two-firewatch)
colorscheme and my own custom statusline.

Complex as Vim may be, it's become so ingrained in my brain and muscle memory
that using anything else is an utter chore.

### Git

I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as my VCS of choice. I have limited experience
with [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/), but I find Git to be superior.
Using Git from the command line may seem hardcore, but I would much rather take
the time to understand the mechanics of what Git is doing than rely on some GUI
abstraction that makes weighty operations just a little too easy.

### Design software

At one time or another, I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), [Adobe
XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), and
[Figma](https://www.figma.com/). They all have their pros and cons, and I do
admire the level to which some people can operate them. I just have the hardest
time adjusting my HTML/CSS/JS-oriented thinking to their differing paradigms.

My ideal process involves sketching in varying levels of fidelity before jumping
straight into code. To that end, I've taken to using an
[iPad](#129-ipad-pro-2018-with-apple-pencil-2) with [Goodnotes](#Goodnotes-5)
for my primary design software experience.

### Mozilla Firefox

I moved over to Firefox at the prodding of a coworker a few months ago. I don't
know that it's leagues better than Chrome, but I do appreciate using something
other than Google's version of the web. I've also become less invested in the
Google ecosystem as I dig farther into Apple's, so shedding Chrome hasn't been a
big loss.

I have the rest of the browser gang for testing, including a couple of Windows
VMs for checking things out in Internet Explorer and Edge. Though Firefox is my
daily driver, I've taken to using Safari when I'm running on the Mac's battery
and simply consuming media. Since it's so tightly coupled and optimized to
macOS, I get waaaaay better battery life than using Firefox.

### Slack

Just about every industry-related professional or social conglomeration I'm a
part of uses [Slack](https://slack.com/) these days. I'm not a huge fan of its
lack of notification management, but it does its job about as well as any of the
other options. The recently added dark mode is a nice touch for when I need it.

### Goodnotes 5

I touched on this briefly in the [iPad](#129-ipad-pro-2019-with-apple-pencil-2)
section above, but I use [Goodnotes 5](https://www.goodnotes.com/) quite a lot.
It has my planner, my work and personal notes, my to do lists, notes from
church&mdash;just about anything I would care to write down is done so within a
Goodnotes notebook. Its notebook/paper concept really resonates with me, and
made it very straightforward to transition from my physical mediums to digital.
I was even able to create a few custom templates that make my digital planner
and notebooks look just like their plant-based ancestors.

Goodnotes' share features are also great for collaborating with colleagues. I
can either export a single page (or entire notebook) as a PDF and send it
straight to a destination in Slack, or use the lasso tool to capture a specific
area and share that as an image. When it's time for updates, I can easily create
new pages so that we can always reference back to previous items. I have already
used it to much success for a couple of new features at work, and am excited
about making it an ever-growing part of my workflow.

### Spotify

Google killed Google Play Music, so I moved over to Spotify. Most of my music
seems to be here and the [Spotify Connect](https://www.spotify.com/us/connect/)
feature is pretty slick, so I suppose I've come out ahead. I'm not a big snob on
music services and the quality of audio they deliver, so long as I can listen to
the things I'm interested in.
