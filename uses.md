I've been cataloguing the [various iterations of my home
office](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ACREAarZbYRAi4632) for years now, but I
haven't really kept a record of what kit I'm currently using. Here's my attempt
to rectify that.

As a general rule, I do everything I can to keep my desk as spotless as
possible. Clean workspace, clean mindset. There are some things that demand a
permanent presence, however. These are the physical doodads that hang around my
desk area.

### The desk

Over the years, I've become more and more obsessed with increasing the total
area of my desk top. The previous version of my home office featured a
[wall-mounted, standing-height
desk](https://photos.app.goo.gl/8U47YDR3SJFcgAJx1) that clocked in at 30 sq.
ft. When we moved the office to add more work space for my wife, I opted for a
more traditional desk so that we would have the flexibility of rearranging the
room at any time.

This current desk is a standard dimension, [solid-core
door](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Masonite-32-in-x-80-in-Smooth-Flush-Unfinished-Hardwood-Solid-Core-Birch-Veneer-Composite-Interior-Door-Slab-25344/100037604)
on top of some [steel tube
legs](https://www.hairpinlegs.com/collections/table-legs/products/tube-leg-no-one).
While it isn't the sprawling expanse that the previous desk was, it certainly
provides plenty of space to spread out.

### MacBook Pro

I'm currently using a 2015 13" MacBook Pro with 8GB of memory and a 512GB SSD.
Three years feels like a long time to use the same MacBook, but it still does
everything I need it to just as fast as the day I got it. For cases where I need
more horsepower, like some development work at Intelliquip, I typically remote
into some sort of server that can be more specially tuned for the task at hand.

I keep my Mac in clamshell mode when I'm at home, and recently grabbed [a
stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0792C2XW7/) to reduce its footprint.
The stand also elevates the laptop off the desk to guard against any accidental
spills.

### Keyboard

This is the item that always grabs attention when I take it out in public. I use
a [Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue Wireless Ergonomic Keyboard for
Mac](https://www.amazon.com/Freestyle2-Wireless-Ergonomic-Keyboard-Separation/dp/B00V6WWYN2/),
with the extra [VIP3 Accessory
Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Accessory-Kinesis-Freestyle2-Keyboard-KIN-FS-VIP3/dp/B008BVNQW4/),
and I can't imagine using anything else. My ergonomic keyboard journey started
with the crowd-favorite [Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard
4000](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A6PPOK/), but after encountering
some muscle strain from constantly reaching across the numpad to use the mouse,
I went searching for something else.

The Kinesis allows my arms to rest in a much more natural position when typing,
as well as freeing up space inside the keyboard for my mouse and notebooks. It
connects over bluetooth and has astonishingly long battery life. Probably the
best thing I have on my desk.

### Mouse

Keeping with the ergonomic theme, I use a [Kensington Expert Wireless Trackball
Mouse](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01936N73I/) as my input device of
choice. Using just my finger tips to move the mouse is a massive relief to the
normal strain of using more arm and wrist muscles to move a traditional device.

It isn't perfect&mdash;there are occasional connection quirks when waking the Mac
from sleep, and using its bluetooth option when other bluetooth devices are
connected to the Mac just doesn't work well at all&mdash;but it's still a huge
improvement over what I had.

### Displays and stand

The pair of Dell S2340M monitors on my desk are two of the oldest tech items I
still use. They only have DVI, so I use a couple of [Mini DisplayPort to DVI
cables](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KAM3ICO/) to connect them to my
Mac. They also aren't VESA compatible, so I use [some
adapters](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076234KMD/) to mount them to the
[monitor stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009S750LA/).

I also have an [Insignia Roku
TV](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/insignia-39-class-38-5-diag--led-1080p-smart-hdtv-roku-tv/4863802.p?skuId=4863802)
mounted next to my desk as a tertiary display. I can connect to it via HDMI if
necessary, but I typically just use its smart features and a [2015
Chromecast](https://store.google.com/product/chromecast_2015) to put on
background media.

### Speakers and sound

For personal music and video playing, I have the [Logitech
Z623](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VAHYTG/) system hooked up to my Mac.
For more general background music, and audio from the Roku TV, I have a pair of
Bose bookshelf speakers wired up with a [Chromecast
Audio](https://store.google.com/product/chromecast_audio). This allows anyone in
the office to control the music without tying up any one person's workstation.

### Phone

I'm currently rocking the [Moto
E4+](https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Plus-4th-Generation-Lockscreen/dp/B072ZS6JD2/)
from Motorola (plus [this nifty folio
case](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0789V3VW3/)). I've used my fair share
of the "latest and greatest" phones, but they all fall short in one key area:
the battery. It doesn't matter how great the advertised battery life is, they
always seem to falter when subjected to normal, continuous use.

Last year (2017), after falling victim to the infamous Nexus 6P battery issue and
increasingly terrible experiences with Google Project Fi, I decided I had
enough. The E4+ is about as uninspiring a phone as could possibly be, but it has
a 5000mAH battery and can easily last three days on a single charge.

### Miscellaneous

Here are the rest of the items on and around my desk that don't need as much
explanation:

- [AmazonBasics USB hub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E6GX4BG/)
- [Jabra Speak 410 USB
  Speakerphone](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007SHJIO2/) for meetings and
phone calls
- [Toshiba 1TB Portable HDD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N2S6ZUQ/)
  for a TimeMachine backup
- [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/pitch-black-memo) and
  [Moleskine](https://us.moleskine.com/en/cahier-journal-brown/p0408) notebooks
- [Cross ballpoint pen](https://www.cross.com/en/products/3502)
- Desk organizer from [Stone-Penland
  Pottery](https://www.facebook.com/stonepenlandpottery/)
- [Safco Foot Cushion](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MS6XW8/)

## Software

I'm sure I've missed some hugely important piece of software in this list, but
here's everything I could think of that I use on a nearly daily basis.

### macOS

I'm currently running [macOS 10.13 High
Sierra](https://www.apple.com/macos/high-sierra/) on my MacBook Pro. I've used
various versions of Windows and Ubuntu before this. I'll refrain from saying
anything too tribal, and stick to the opinion that for the kind of work I do,
this machine and OS has been the most pleasant experience by far. The end
&#x1F603;

### iTerm2

I try to hang out in the terminal as much as possible. It's the primary place
where I traverse the filesystem, edit text, use Git, log in to remote servers,
etc. To help keep all of this in order, I use the excellent
[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/). I'm sure the built-in terminal app would be
fine for most of what I do, but iTerm is always recommended for new Mac users.
After three years, nothing else has managed to lure me away.

### Vim

Yep, I use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/). There are a lot of fancy GUI editors
these days, but the punishing intricacy of Vim has me firmly in its grasp.
Nothing else I've used gives me the ability to "edit at the speed of thought,"
so to speak.

I try to keep my configuration of Vim fairly vanilla, opting for just a few
plugins and other added niceties. Beyond Tim Pope's
[vim-cucumber](https://github.com/tpope/vim-cucumber/),
[vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/), and
[vim-rails](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails/), the most exciting things I've
added are the [vim-two-firewatch](https://github.com/rakr/vim-two-firewatch)
colorscheme and my own custom statusline.

Complex as Vim may be, it's become so ingrained in my brain and muscle memory
that using anything else is an utter chore.


### Git

I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as my VCS of choice. I have limited experience
with [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/), but I find Git to be superior.
Using Git from the command line may seem hardcore, but I would much rather take
the time to understand the mechanics of what Git is doing than rely on some GUI
abstraction that makes weighty operations just a little too easy.

### Balsamiq, Adobe XD, Figma&hellip;

If the front-end world is suffering from "framework fatigue," the design world
is doing its best to keep pace by self-inflicting "design software fatigue."
There are untold number of options in this space, but these are the players I
keep up with.

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was my first entry to design/prototype
software. Though I've moved on to higher-fidelity tools, I appreciate their
mission and wish I could've made more use of it.

I started using [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) when it was
in beta. Its sharing features were an absolute god-send: being able to share a
design, and any of its updates, with a single URL greatly increased our ability
to collaborate on and validate design ideas. I switched to Figma when they
introduced the subscription plan, but may someday find my way back now that it's
free again.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is the tool I currently use. Its sharing
features are *not* as slick as Adobe XD's, but I do think the web app nature of
the program gives it advantages in other areas.

I don't use any of these design tools to a very high level, primarily because
it's easier for me to go straight from pencil and paper to code, but there are
certainly times where being able to iterate on a static mockup can increase
participation in collaborating on ideas. It's a skill I have to keep working on,
as much as I'd like to ditch the thing entirely and stick to writing the HTML
and CSS from the beginning. Sometimes you just need that shareable picture.

### Google Chrome

I'm more invested in the Google ecosystem than any other, so I use
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) primarily out of convenience than
anything else. I do find it a little more comfortable to use than Firefox, and
much prefer its interface to other browsers. I do wish I knew how to get more
out of the advanced dev tool features for testing and debugging.

I have the rest of the browser gang for testing, including a couple of Windows
VMs for checking things out in Internet Explorer and Edge. Though Chrome is my
daily driver, I've taken to using Safari when I'm running on the Mac's battery
and simply consuming media. Since it's so tightly coupled and optimized to
macOS, I get waaaaay better battery life than using Chrome.

### Slack and Stride

[Intelliquip](https://intelliquip.com/) uses Atlassian's
[Stride](https://www.stride.com/) (which was [just bought by
Slack](https://slackhq.com/atlassian-and-slack-partnership) while I was writing
this section &#x1F602;) for our daily communications. It's&hellip;a chat
program. Moving on&hellip;

I'm a member of a few different software groups in Knoxville, all of which use
[Slack](https://slack.com/) to keep in touch. I prefer it to Stride, and am
looking forward to what comes of the aforementioned acquisition.
