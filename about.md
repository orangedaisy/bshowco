### Hi, I'm Bobby.

By day, I work for [Intelliquip,
Inc.](https://www.intelliquip.com) as a User Experience Engineer. By night, I do
web design for [orange daisy](http://www.orangedaisy.co).

I live in Knoxville, TN with my wife, our son, and our yorkie. I occasionally
opine on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/bobbyshowalter/), post pictures to my
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bobbyshowalter/), and experiment on
[CodePen](https://www.codepen.io/reverendgeneral/). My
[Github](https://github.com/orangedaisy/) is available if you're interested,
though most of my heavy-hitting work is either in private repos or winds up on
Intelliquip's Bitbucket.

I'm happy to chat anytime through the above means, or more directly at
[bobby.showalter@gmail.com](mailto:bobby.showalter@gmail.com).
