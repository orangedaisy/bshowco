### Hi, I'm Bobby.

{% include figure.html src='/assets/images/profile-picture.jpg' alt='Picture of
Bobby and his son Owen' caption='Me and my son, Owen' %}

By day, I work for [Intelliquip,
Inc.](https://www.intelliquip.com) as a User Experience Engineer. By night, I do
web design for [orange daisy](https://www.orangedaisy.co). I'm a member of [Knox
Devs](https://www.knoxdevs.com), and a co-founding member of the group's
[Knox UX meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Knox-UX/).

I live in Knoxville, TN with my wife, our son, and our yorkie. I occasionally
opine on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/bobbyshowalter/), post pictures to my
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bobbyshowalter/), and experiment on
[CodePen](https://www.codepen.io/bobbyshowalter/). My
[Github](https://github.com/orangedaisy/) is available if you're interested,
though most of my heavy-hitting work is either in private repos or winds up on
Intelliquip's Bitbucket. Due to the nature of my work at Intelliquip, I'm unable
to post publicly about the specifics of problems and solutions I encounter.
However, I'd be more than happy to chat with you over email or VoIP if there's
anything in particular you'd like to know.

I'm available to chat anytime through the above means, or more directly at
[bobby.showalter@gmail.com](mailto:bobby.showalter@gmail.com).
